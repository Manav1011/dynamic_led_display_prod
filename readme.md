# Title - Advanced Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

### Description

Our Real-Time Weather Monitoring System is an integrated solution comprising cutting-edge hardware and software components. Designed to showcase weather data through a network of sensors at remote locations, this system is a technological marvel. The sensors transmit data to a sophisticated data logger, which, in turn, communicates through the computer system using the efficient rs485 serial communication channel. The client's computer system, armed with specialized software, receives, decodes, and transfers this data seamlessly to a remote web server via a websocket connection. Access to the weather data is secured through a user-friendly website, ensuring authentication and data privacy.

In addition to real-time weather data, the system boasts insightful analytics graphs and visualizations derived from stored data. Notably, the system extends its functionality to include an LED panel display for industries. The LED panel, integrated with a network card, connects to the remote server, allowing the display of raw data or HTML-formatted content. Clients have the power to control the LED panel content through the software, showcasing real-time weather updates, text, clock, images, videos, and more.

### Workflow

1. Register with the system to receive client software.
2. Connect the system to the data logger using the rs485 cable.
3. Run the client software, establishing a websocket connection to the server.
4. Decode binary data received through rs485 and send it to the remote web server.
5. Receive a private webpage URL upon connection for real-time weather data access.
6. Explore the webpage, featuring analytics, charts, and graphs.
7. Optionally, industries can install an LED panel, controlling content through the software.
8. Customize LED panel content with various data formats and animations.

### Tech Stack

- Webapp: Developed with Django for a robust and user-friendly interface.
- Web Server: Utilizes Daphne, an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) for scalability and optimization.
- Communication: Supports various protocols such as HTTP and WebSockets.
- Client Software: Leverages open-source Python libraries for rs485 data retrieval and transfer via the websocket channel.

### Business Model

Clients can choose from various options tailored to their needs:

1. **Data Storage:** Decide between storing data on-premises or on the cloud (Chargeable).
2. **Analytics Options:** Opt for analytics only or a comprehensive package including analytics and LED panel features.
3. **Offline Operation:** Run the webserver on-premises without an internet connection, ensuring privacy compliance.
