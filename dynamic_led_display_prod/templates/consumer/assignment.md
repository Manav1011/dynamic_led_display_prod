### CO1: Understanding Engineering Ethics and Professionalism

##### 1. Define Engineering Ethics. Distinguish between ethics, laws, and morals. (L1)

**Engineering Ethics:**
Engineering ethics refers to the set of moral principles and professional standards that guide the behavior of individuals in the field of engineering. It encompasses the obligations of engineers to society, their clients, and the profession.

**Distinguishing between Ethics, Laws, and Morals:**

- **Ethics:** A system of moral principles that governs the behavior of individuals and groups. Ethics are often codified into a formal system or set of rules, which are explicitly adopted by a group of people. In the context of engineering, ethics pertain to the professional standards and expectations set for practitioners.
- **Laws:** Formal rules and regulations that are established by a governing authority to maintain order and protect the rights and safety of individuals. Laws are enforceable by the state, and violations can result in penalties or legal consequences.
- **Morals:** Personal beliefs and values about what is right and wrong, often derived from cultural, religious, or philosophical backgrounds. Morals are subjective and can vary significantly between individuals and communities.

##### 2. Differentiate personal ethics & business ethics. (L2)

**Personal Ethics:**
Personal ethics refer to an individual’s own set of values and principles that guide their behavior in everyday life. These are shaped by personal beliefs, cultural influences, and life experiences.

**Business Ethics:**
Business ethics, on the other hand, pertain to the moral principles that guide the actions and decisions of a business organization. These ethics help in determining what is acceptable behavior within a business context, influencing how a company conducts its operations, treats its employees, and interacts with customers and the broader community.

While personal ethics are individual and internal, business ethics are often formalized, communicated, and enforced through company policies, codes of conduct, and corporate governance structures.

##### 3. Describe Relationship between morality and Laws. (L1)

The relationship between morality and laws is complex and multifaceted. Laws are often based on moral principles and are designed to uphold societal values and protect individuals’ rights. However, not all moral beliefs are codified into law, and not all laws are perceived as moral by every individual or community.

- **Alignment:** In many cases, laws reflect the moral values of a society. For example, laws against stealing or harming others align with widespread moral beliefs about respecting others’ property and well-being.
- **Conflict:** Sometimes, laws may conflict with individual or group moral beliefs. In such cases, individuals might challenge the laws or work to change them.
- **Independence:** There are areas where morality and law operate independently. Some moral obligations are not enforced by law, and some legal requirements may not align with an individual’s moral beliefs.

Etiquette involves the customary codes of polite behavior in society or among members of a particular profession or group. It is more about social conventions and less about moral principles.

Professional codes are formalized rules and standards adopted by a profession to guide the behavior of its members. These codes reflect the ethical obligations of professionals and help in maintaining integrity and trust in the profession.

##### 1. Differentiate between Values and Ethics. (L2)

**Values:**
Values are the beliefs and principles that an individual or a group holds to be important. They guide behavior and choices, reflecting what is considered significant and worthwhile. Values are subjective and can vary widely between different cultures, communities, and individuals.

**Ethics:**
Ethics, on the other hand, is a system of moral principles that guide behavior and decision-making. It involves distinguishing between right and wrong and acting accordingly. Ethics are often codified into a set of rules or guidelines that are adopted by a particular group or profession.

- **P:** Policies (Is it consistent with my organization’s policies, procedures, and guidelines?)
- **L:** Legal (Is it acceptable under the applicable laws and regulations?)
- **U:** Universal (Does it conform to the universal principles/values my organization has adopted?)
- **S:** Self (Does it satisfy my personal definition of right, good, and fair?)

By considering these four dimensions, individuals can ensure that their decisions are well-rounded, compliant with external standards, and aligned with both personal and organizational values.
